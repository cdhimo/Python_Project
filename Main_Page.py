Data:       Boston Crime 2023
URL:        Link to your web application on Streamlit Cloud (if posted)

Description: This program: Uses crime data from Boston as of 2023 and consists of a sample of 7000 cases. For this project I used various functions to filter data and
focused on friday-sunday as the data when mapped was too clustered if I did not do so. I also wanted to focus on a specific aspect of the data which was weekends. I wanted to
solve the question of where should you hang-out in Boston for the weekend. I created three charts: line_chart,Bar_Chart, and a pie chart. I used various streamlit widgets to customize the look and used different widgets to also select certain data for the charts.
I also used altair which was used for one of my charts this is a package that we did not use within class.I used many python applications such as list comprehnsion,dictionaires,and functions to manipulate data frames and filter data.
Overall, this project created a unique dashboard in streamlit displaying different data to get a picture of bosotn crime on the weekends for 2023.
